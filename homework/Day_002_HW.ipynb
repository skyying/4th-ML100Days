    "> Computer science defines AI research as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.”[61]\n",

    "> Learning data representations iwth use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing unit\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[11](pp199–200) uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces."
